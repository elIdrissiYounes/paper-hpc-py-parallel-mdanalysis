\label{sec:tcomm}
In addition to the compute to I/O ratio discussed in Section \ref{sec:bound} we define another performance parameter called the compute to communication ratio $t_{\text{comp}}/t_{\text{comm}}$.
In Section \ref{sec:I/O}, we overcame the I/O effect by splitting the trajectory, but scaling remained far from ideal when MPI communication was used (instead of  Global Arrays).
This is because the task remained communication bound (Figure \ref{fig:MPIwithIO-split}), i.e, 
\begin{gather*}
  \frac{t_{\text{comp}}}{t_{\text{comm}}} \ll 1.
\end{gather*}

Figure \ref{fig:tcom_tcomm_effect} shows the relationship of performance with \tcomp/\tcomm ratio.
When the \tcomp/\tcomm ratio is higher (Figure \ref{fig:tcomp_tcomm_ratio}), performance is better (Figure \ref{fig:S1_tcomp_tcomm_effect}) even if communication time is larger (Figure \ref{fig:Comm_time_tcomp_tcomm_effect}).
Although, we still observed stragglers due to communication at larger \tcomp/\tcomm ratios ($70\times$ RMSD and $100\times$ RMSD), their effect on performance remained modest because the overall performance was dominated by the compute load. 
Evidently, if overall performance is dominated by a component such as compute that scales well, then performance problems with components such as communication will be masked and overall acceptable performance can still be achieved (Figures \ref{fig:S1_tcomp_tcomm_effect} and \ref{fig:tcomp_tcomm_ratio}).

Communication is usually not problematic within one node because of the shared memory environment (for less than 24 processes (single compute node on \emph{SDSC Comet}) the scaling is good and $\frac{\tcomp}{\tcomm} \gg 1$ for all RMSD loads) (Figures \ref{fig:S1_tcomp_tcomm_effect} and \ref{fig:tcomp_tcomm_ratio}).
However, beyond a single compute node, scaling appears to get better as the \tcomp/\tcomm ratio increases and communication overhead becomes less dominant (Figures \ref{fig:S1_tcomp_tcomm_effect} and \ref{fig:tcomp_tcomm_ratio}, 24-72 cores represent multiple compute nodes on \emph{SDSC Comet}).
