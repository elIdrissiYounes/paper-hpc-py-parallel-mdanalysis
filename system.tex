\label{system}
The test system contained the protein adenylate kinase with 214 amino acid residues and 3341 atoms in total \cite{Seyler:2014il}. 
The trajectory was in Gromacs XTC format trajectory (``600x'' in \citet{Khoshlessan:2017ab}) with a size of about 30 GB and 2,512,200
time frames (corresponding to $602.4 \sim \mu s$ simulated time) which represents a typical medium per-frame size but is very long for
current standards.

The experiments were executed on the XSEDE Supercomputers: \emph{SDSC Comet}. 
SDSC Comet is a 2.7 PFlop/s cluster with 6,400 nodes in total.
The standard compute nodes consist of Intel Xeon E5-2680v3 processors, 128 GB DDR4 DRAM (64 GB per socket), and 320 GB of SSD local scratch memory. 
The large memory nodes contain 1.5 TB of DRAM and four Haswell processors each and the network topology is 56 Gbps FDR Infini-Band.
All the experiments in the present study are performed using compute nodes.
