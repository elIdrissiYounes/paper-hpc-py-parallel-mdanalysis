Parallel implementation of the three dimensional time series is performed in the following steps:

\begin{description}
  \item[\textbf{Step 1}] Calculate the value of \tcomp/\tIO to see whether the task is compute bound ($\frac{\tcomp}{\tIO} \gg 1$) or IO bound ($\frac{\tcomp}{\tIO} \ll 1$). As discussed in Section \ref{bound} for I/O bound problems both communication and I/O will be a problem and the performance of the task will be affected by the straggler tasks which delay job completion time.  
  
  \item[\textbf{Step 2}] For $\frac{\tcomp}{\tIO} \geqslant 100$ the task is compute bound and the task will scale very well as we showed in Section \ref{DF}. However, if the size of the data to be communicated to rank 0 using the blocking collective communication ($MPI.Gather()$) is large, one might consider using global arrays to achieve near ideal scaling behavior (Section \ref{Global-Array}). Application of Global array is useful in the sense that it replaces message-passing interface with a distributed shared array where its blocks will be updated by the associated rank in the communication domain (Algorithm \ref{alg:GA}). 
  \item[\textbf{Step 3}] For $\frac{\tcomp}{\tIO} \leqslant 100$ the task is I/O bound and then you need to take the following steps:
   
\begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] If there is access to HDF5 format the recommended way will be to use MPI-based Parallel HDF5 (Section \ref{HDF5}). Since converting the XTC file to HDF5 is expensive if the trajectory file formats are not in HDF5 form then one might prefer to split the trajectories. 
  \item[$\bullet$] The trajectory file should be splitted into as many trajectory segments as the number of processes.
  \item[$\bullet$] The appropriate parallel implementation along with \emph{Global Array} should be used on the trajectory segments (Section \ref{Splitting}).
